	    	Brahma Kumaris is the largest spiritual organisation in the world led by women. It was the founder, Prajapita Brahma Baba, who chose to put women in front from the very beginning, and it has set Brahma Kumaris apart on the stage of the world's religions and spiritual organisations. For over 80 years their leadership has been characterised by steady courage, a capacity for forgiveness and a deep commitment to unity.

	    	Mount Abu, high in the Aravali Mountains of Rajasthan, provided an ideal location for reflection and contemplation for the original group's move from Karachi in 1950. After a few years in a rented building, the community moved to the present site which remains the Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya <strong>(Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University)</strong>. The Brahma Kumaris spiritual headquarters is known as <strong style="color:red"> Madhuban (â€˜Forest of Honey')</style>.
