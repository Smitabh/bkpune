			<h3>The Brahma Kumaris Story</h3>
				<p class="para">	
			Mount Abu, high in the Aravali Mountains of Rajasthan, provided an ideal location for reflection and contemplation for the original group's move from Karachi in 1950. After a few years in a rented building, the community moved to the present site which remains the Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya <strong>(Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University)</strong>. The Brahma Kumaris spiritual headquarters is known as <strong style="color:red"> Madhuban (â€˜Forest of Honey')</style>. </ion-card-content>
